# ETL Service
ETL Service (REST API performing extract, transform and load operations) using Scala & http4s

##### This is a classic ETL Service, backed by Scala & http4s. It demonstrates:
* Extensible and maintainable design
* Used FP fundamentals to complete this design.
* Enough Unit tests and API (or integration tests) are available.
* Well logging & monitoring implemented as and when itâ€™s needed.
* Good Error handling implementation.
